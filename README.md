## Descriptive World Project Outfit

### Authors - Blair Jones, Jorge Hernandez, Jack Wang, Matt White

Project outfit is a capstone project of four students for the Master in Information and Data Science course at UC Berkeley. The idea of the project was to construct an application for clothing type classification directed toward the visually impaired and utlimately an api for building future features for the target audience. The project constructs a computer vision model, using YOLOv5, that is able detect 11 types of clothes, color, and texture/pattern of the clothing in both an AWS and IOS implementation.
